## WA Road Analytics Project

This project is an end-to-end data engineering and analytics pipeline built using Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Gen2, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Tableau. The goal of the project was to analyzes various public transport and road infrastructure datasets published on data.wa.gov.au to get insights into traffic patterns, road safety, infrastructure coverage, and roadwork disruptions across Western Australia.
